# Library-management
A **Library Management System** software designed to manage and automate library operations efficiently. It helps librarians handle book cataloging, member registration, book issuing, returning, and fine calculation. The system maintains a digital database of books, authors, publishers, and users, reducing manual record-keeping errors. Students and staff can search book availability, reserve books, and track borrowing history through an online interface. It improves data security, saves time, and enhances overall library services. Features like barcode scanning, report generation, inventory management, and user authentication make the system reliable, organized, and suitable for modern academic and public libraries.
